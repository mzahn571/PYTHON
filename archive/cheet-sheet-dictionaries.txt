# Looping through a dictionary
# You can loop through a dictionary in three ways: you can
# loop through all the key-value pairs, all the keys, or all the
# values.
# Dictionaries keep track of the order in which key-value
# pairs are added. If you want to process the information in a
# different order, you can sort the keys in your loop.
# Looping through all key-value pairs

# Store people's favorite languages.
    fav_languages = {
        'jen': 'python',
        'sarah': 'c',
        'edward': 'ruby',
        'phil': 'python',
        }

# Show each person's favorite language.
    for name, language in fav_languages.items():
        print(f"{name}: {language}")
        
#Looping through all the keys
    # Show everyone who's taken the survey.
    for name in fav_languages.keys():
        print(name)

# Looping through all the values
    # Show all the languages that have been chosen.
    for language in fav_languages.values():
        print(language)

# Looping through all the keys in reverse order
    # Show each person's favorite language,
    # in reverse order by the person's name.
    for name in sorted(fav_languages.keys(),
            reverse=True):
        print(f"{name}: language")
        
# What are dictionaries?
# Python's dictionaries allow you to connect pieces of
# related information. Each piece of information in a
# dictionary is stored as a key-value pair. When you
# provide a key, Python returns the value associated
# with that key. You can loop through all the key-value
# pairs, all the keys, or all the values.
# Accessing values
# To access the value associated with an individual key give
# the name of the dictionary and then place the key in a set of
# square brackets. If the key you're asking for is not in the
# dictionary, an error will occur.
# You can also use the get() method, which returns None
# instead of an error if the key doesn't exist. You can also
# specify a default value to use if the key is not in the
# dictionary.

# Getting the value associated with a key
    alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
    
    print(alien_0['color'])
    print(alien_0['points'])
    
#Getting the value with get()
    alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}
    
    alien_color = alien_0.get('color')
    alien_points = alien_0.get('points', 0)
    
    print(alien_color)
    print(alien_points)
    
# Modifying values
# You can modify the value associated with any key in a
# dictionary. To do so give the name of the dictionary and
# enclose the key in square brackets, then provide the new
# value for that key.

# Modifying values in a dictionary
    alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
    print(alien_0)

    # Change the alien's color and point value.
    alien_0['color'] = 'yellow'
    alien_0['points'] = 10
    print(alien_0)

# Removing key-value pairs
# You can remove any key-value pair you want from a
# dictionary. To do so use the del keyword and the dictionary
# name, followed by the key in square brackets. This will
# delete the key and its associated value.

# Deleting a key-value pair
    alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
    print(alien_0)
    
    del alien_0['points']
    print(alien_0)

# Adding new key-value pairs
# You can store as many key-value pairs as you want in a
# dictionary, until your computer runs out of memory. To add
# a new key-value pair to an existing dictionary give the name
# of the dictionary and the new key in square brackets, and
# set it equal to the new value.
# This also allows you to start with an empty dictionary and
# add key-value pairs as they become relevant.

# Adding a key-value pair
    alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
    
    alien_0['x'] = 0
    alien_0['y'] = 25
    alien_0['speed'] = 1.5
    
#Adding to an empty dictionary
    alien_0 = {}
    alien_0['color'] = 'green'
    alien_0['points'] = 5

# Nesting ‒ A list of dictionaries

# this is called nesting.

# Dictionary Comprehensions
# A comprehension is a compact way of generating a
# dictionary, similar to a list comprehension.
# To make a dictionary comprehension, define an
# expression for the key-value pairs you want to make. Then
# write a for loop to generate the values that will feed into this
# expression.
# The zip() function matches each item in one list to each
# item in a second list. It can be used to make a dictionary
# from two lists.

# Using loop to make a dictionary
    squares = {}

        squares[x] = x**2

# Nesting ‒ A dictionary of dictionaries
# You can store a dictionary inside another dictionary. In this
# case each value associated with a key is itself a dictionary.

# Levels of nesting
# Nesting is extremely useful in certain situations. However,
# be aware of making your code overly complex. If you're
# nesting items much deeper than what you see here there
# are probably simpler ways of managing your data, such as
# using classes.
# Generating a million dictionaries
# You can use a loop to generate a large number of
# dictionaries efficiently, if all the dictionaries start out with
# similar data.
